# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-12)

**Core value:** A mahasiswa can find a book and request to borrow it, a pustakawan can approve/hand it over, and the system tracks the loan through to return — automatically calculating fines on late returns.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation, Schema & Auth

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation, Schema & Auth)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-12 — Roadmap created, 24/24 v1 requirements mapped across 5 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: docker-compose (DEPLOY-01) and both NFRs (API latency, responsive layout) are bundled into Phase 1 so the full-stack skeleton and quality bars are established from day one, not deferred to a final polish phase.
- [Roadmap]: Loan workflow split into two phases — Phase 3 covers request→approval→pickup→handover (loan creation/activation), Phase 4 covers return→fine→block→notify (loan closure) — matching the natural state-machine boundary in `STATUS_PEMINJAMAN`.
- [Roadmap]: Dashboard, member management, and mahasiswa loan history grouped into Phase 5 since all three are read/reporting views over data produced by Phases 2-4.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: LOAN-05 (2x24h pickup auto-cancellation) requires a time-based check — confirm during planning whether this is a scheduled job, a lazy check-on-read, or both, since the project has no background worker yet.
- [Phase 4]: RET-03 (Brevo notification stub) needs a defined "logged" format (e.g., structured log line or DB table) for verification — clarify during Phase 4 planning.
