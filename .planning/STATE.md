# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-12)

**Core value:** A mahasiswa can find a book and request to borrow it, a pustakawan can approve/hand it over, and the system tracks the loan through to return — automatically calculating fines on late returns.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Book Catalog

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Book Catalog)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-13 — Phase 1 shipped to phase-1-foundation branch — UAT 11/11 passed

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: - min
- Total execution time: - hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation, Schema & Auth | 4 | 4 | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01, 01-02, 01-03, 01-04
- Trend: Phase 1 completed successfully

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: docker-compose (DEPLOY-01) and both NFRs (API latency, responsive layout) are bundled into Phase 1 so the full-stack skeleton and quality bars are established from day one, not deferred to a final polish phase.
- [Roadmap]: Loan workflow split into two phases — Phase 3 covers request→approval→pickup→handover (loan creation/activation), Phase 4 covers return→fine→block→notify (loan closure) — matching the natural state-machine boundary in `STATUS_PEMINJAMAN`.
- [Roadmap]: Dashboard, member management, and mahasiswa loan history grouped into Phase 5 since all three are read/reporting views over data produced by Phases 2-4.
- [Phase 1]: All 4 plans executed successfully. Backend: schema + migrations + auth API (4 tests GREEN). Frontend: Vite/React/Tailwind with auth UI + role-aware shell. Infra: docker-compose, Dockerfiles, entrypoint, env, README.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: LOAN-05 (2x24h pickup auto-cancellation) requires a time-based check — confirm during planning whether this is a scheduled job, a lazy check-on-read, or both, since the project has no background worker yet.
- [Phase 4]: RET-03 (Brevo notification stub) needs a defined "logged" format (e.g., structured log line or DB table) for verification — clarify during Phase 4 planning.
- [Phase 2 — override]: Decision Coverage Gate flagged D-01, D-03, D-08, D-09, D-10, D-14, D-15 as not literally cited by `D-NN:` ID in any plan's `must_haves`/`truths`. The plan-checker confirmed all are substantively implemented in plan tasks (D-01 Kelola tab in 02-04, D-08 debounced search in 02-01/02-02, D-09/D-10 category filter in 02-01/02-02, D-13/14/15 placeholder covers in 02-02, etc.) — user chose "Proceed anyway" since this is a citation/traceability gap, not a missing-feature gap. verify-phase should re-check these decisions against the shipped code.
